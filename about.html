        <p>Kevin and I started dating our senior year of high school in North Carolina. We got married about 5 years later and our time together has now totaled about 11 years. Wow! Time flies when you are having fun! Kevin is the funniest, friendliest, and most generous person I have ever met, and I am so excited for the adventures we have yet to embark on together.</p>

        <img src="familyPhoto4.jpg" height="300px">
        <p>My immediate family started out with my wonderful, supporting parents and my beautiful, talented sister Ashley. When I got married I was fortunate to have my family grow with the best in-laws anyone could ask for. I gained another set of parents AND another sister! That wasn't the end for new family members for me though... in 2013, I became an Aunt to a very busy and smart Alexander!</p>

        <p>My friends are a huge part of my life. I am very fortunate to have so many from where I grew up in North Carolina and where Kevin and I have settled in Florida. We have had numerous adventures, endless laughs, and great support with them. They are a part of our family.</p>

        <p>There is a lot that could be said about this one. I'll try and keep it short. We adopted Lilu in North Carolina when she was about 4 months old, she is now 7! She loves to go on kayak adventures with us and loves to destroy tennis balls. She makes me laugh so hard to the point of tears sometimes.</p>

        <h1>My Current Career</h1>
        <img src="careerPhoto3.jpg" height="300px">
        <p>I work as a dental hygienist in Orlando, Florida. I have been practicing hygiene for 6 years. It has been a great career that has supported my family tremendously, but I have recently decided to hang up my scalers. Being a dentaly hygienist, chronic pain is part of the norm and can really interfere with your life. Since I am only 28, I have decided it's time to tackle a new dream that will protect my joints and be a longer-lasting career. </p>
